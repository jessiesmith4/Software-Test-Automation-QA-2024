1. How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
   - Testing my software is how I ensure that my programs are functional and secure. Automating testing techniques is a good way to ensure that there are no errors or flaws in the code, and helps to move through testing      faster. In my program I used JUnit testing to ensure that the code was functioning properly.
2. How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
   - I interpret user needs by makinga list of requirements of the program. This helps me ensure that the program has incorporated each need and requirement and helpes me to ensure that the functionality of the program       is correct. 
3. How do I approach designing software?
   - I like to test my code regularly when designing to ensure that I don't run into any problems toward the end of the project. For this project I created functions that met the requirements, and used JUnit tests to         test each function and ensure that variables that could be updated, would be updated, variables that could not be updated, would throw exceptions if someone attempted to change them, that they were withing               character limits, were never NULL, etc.
